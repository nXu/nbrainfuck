nXu    20.01.2014    BugFix:     '[' did not skip the loop when the cell under the pointer was 0 (Issue #1)
                     -Feature:   Due to code changes (preprocessing code to set loop start-end pairs),
					             call stack is no longer in use so it has been removed from the code
								 and from the GUI as well.
